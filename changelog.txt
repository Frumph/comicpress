2.9.2.24
Removed the tabindex from the comments.php field for textarea
adding comic-id-# ($post->id) as a wrap with #comic-wrap so that it can be targeted for the current comic post
added check to see if on the comic_next for hovering over to see if its empty or not, if it is do a # instead of empty ""
Removed comicpress-debug.php, so no debug messages anymore
Removed copyright.php, it hasnt been in use in a long time

2.9.2.23
Adjusted "The Footer" back to just "Footer" the browsers that can't handle it will just have to be SOL
made the is_cp_theme_layout into a function_exists so that it can be rehandled in the child-functions.php

2.9.2.22
Added ?latestcomic=# where # = category #
So you can do ?latestcomic and it will redirect to the latest comic of all categories 
or latestcomic = 3 will redirect to the latestcomic of category ID #3

custom image header now defaults to click to home
