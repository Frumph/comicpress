changed the padding and line-height in the #menubar-wrapper .menu css
added .post-time / .posted-at new function comicpress_display_post_time() which displays the time the post was made.
alt-text/hovertext change in the displaypost.php file, it now outputs the hovertext/alt-text on thumbnails and rss feeds 
and shows the alt-text whether Rascal is active or not
removed extra id="" in the textarea for the comment form, #comment-textarea no longer exists, its just #comment now
set $outputscript = ''; in the displaycomic.php so it doesn't give notice if it doesn't exist, which it doesn't anyways but oh well; future endeavors.

2.9.2.24
Removed the tabindex from the comments.php field for textarea
adding comic-id-# ($post->id) as a wrap with #comic-wrap so that it can be targeted for the current comic post

Removed comicpress-debug.php, so no debug messages anymore
Removed copyright.php, it hasnt been in use in a long time
changed the <div for the post title in the comic blog post widget to an h2 so that ttf replacer plugins can handle it
fixed the /?randomcomic /?randompost to have &nocache=1 on the line so that wp-supercache doesn't cache it
implemented easel's menubar code which uses less CSS then the new comicpress's /cleaned up code/ no images for down arrow -> right arrow no, is text characters
fixed classic menubar's error with the comicpress_get_all_comic_categories_as_cat_string() when its supposed to be: comicpress_all_comic_categories_string()
You can now assign comics to individual posts, which means..  yes.. multiple comics per day with multiple posts.   A little bit extra work than just uploading but works great.
Still need to make comicpress managers bulk editor recognize which comic is assigned to it and think about making an assign comic box for the post editor.
* Added new widget "Tip Jar" widget which lets you set a 'target' donation amount and then set how much in donations 
you currently have and it displays a nice little donation image percentile of how far its got to go to get the target mark

made the is_cp_theme_layout into a function_exists so that it can be rehandled in the child-functions.php
