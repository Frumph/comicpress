2.9.2.23
Adjusted "The Footer" back to just "Footer" the browsers that can't handle it will just have to be SOL
made the is_cp_theme_layout into a function_exists so that it can be rehandled in the child-functions.php

2.9.2.22
Added ?latestcomic=# where # = category #
So you can do ?latestcomic and it will redirect to the latest comic of all categories 
or latestcomic = 3 will redirect to the latestcomic of category ID #3

custom image header now defaults to click to home
