2.9.2.24
Removed the tabindex from the comments.php field for textarea
adding comic-id-# ($post->id) as a wrap with #comic-wrap so that it can be targeted for the current comic post
added check to see if on the comic_next for hovering over to see if its empty or not, if it is do a # instead of empty ""
Removed comicpress-debug.php, so no debug messages anymore
Removed copyright.php, it hasnt been in use in a long time
changed the <div for the post title in the comic blog post widget to an h2 so that ttf replacer plugins can handle it
fixed the /?randomcomic /?randompost to have &nocache=1 on the line so that wp-supercache doesn't cache it
implemented easel's menubar code which uses less CSS then the new comicpress's /cleaned up code/ no images for down arrow -> right arrow no, is text characters
fixed classic menubar's error with the comicpress_get_all_comic_categories_as_cat_string() when its supposed to be: comicpress_all_comic_categories_string()
You can now assign comics to individual posts, which means..  yes.. multiple comics per day with multiple posts.   A little bit extra work than just uploading but works great.
Still need to make comicpress managers bulk editor recognize which comic is assigned to it and think about making an assign comic box for the post editor.
Added new widget "Donation" widget which lets you set a 'target' donation amount and then set how much in donations you currently have and it displays a nice little donation image percentile of how far its got to go to get the target mark
Fixed Notice that appears on 404 and search pages when no results found.


2.9.2.23
Fixed footer - the-footer problem with widgets in the footer area
made the is_cp_theme_layout into a function_exists so that it can be rehandled in the child-functions.php

2.9.2.22
Added ?latestcomic=# where # = category #
So you can do ?latestcomic and it will redirect to the latest comic of all categories 
or latestcomic = 3 will redirect to the latestcomic of category ID #3
custom image header now defaults to click to home
